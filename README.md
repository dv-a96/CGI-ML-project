## Code Parts
Our project consists of three code parts, each contained in its respective folder:

MINST: This folder contains the code for reproducing the results of this article.
Wrist_transfer_learning: This folder holds the code for the third part, where we applied transfer learning to the wrist fracture dataset.
Statistical_Analysis:
Each folder contains a main file, a Dataset class file and a Neural Network class file.
Please download/clone the folder you are interested in. In addition, download/clone the file train_and_test.py.
For the second and third folders also download/clone preprocessing_wrist.py or use the Processed Data folder instead (created using reshape = 64*128, measurements = 1024).
