# CGI-ML-project
#### Authors: Shahr Samur & Dvir Adler

## Dataset
In our project we mainly used two Datasets:
* MNIST
* Wrist

The wrist dataset is a publicly available dataset of wrist X-ray images which we later preprocessed to generate GI measurements for training and evaluating our neural network model. You can download the dataset from here.

## Code Parts
Our project consists of three code parts, each contained in its respective folder:

MINST: This folder contains the code for reproducing the results of this article on MNIST datset.

Wrist_transfer_learning: This folder holds the code where we applied transfer learning to the wrist fracture dataset.

Statistical_Analysis: This golder contain a code that perform analysis to the samples the model from the previous part didn't learn correctly.

To run the project please download/clone the folder you are interested in and see the following detailes.
